    "Human Input Modes\n",
    "Currently AutoGen supports three modes for human input. The mode is specified through the human_input_mode argument of the ConversableAgent. The three modes are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `NEVER:` human input is never requested.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `TERMINATE (default):` human input is only requested when a termination condition is met. Note that in this mode if the human chooses to intercept and reply, the conversation continues and the counter used by max_consecutive_auto_reply is reset.\n",
    "* `ALWAYS:` human input is always requested and the human can choose to skip and trigger an auto-reply, intercept and provide feedback, or terminate the conversation. Note that in this mode termination based on max_consecutive_auto_reply is ignored.\n",
    "\n",
    "The previous chapters already showed many examples of the cases when human_input_mode is NEVER. Below we show one such example again and then show the differences when this mode is set to ALWAYS and TERMINATE instead."
